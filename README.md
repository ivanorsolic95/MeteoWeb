# A tutorial to build your own weather station

This tutorial is designed for enthusiasts with a basic knowledge of Python programming. No prior experience with electronics is required, making it accessible to beginners and seasoned programmers alike.

It includes everything you need, from components to build a weather station, wiring diagrams to connect the components, and code to run your weather station.

I made a separate [repository](https://github.com/ivanorsolic95/MeteoLogic), where I put complete Python code for running the weather station.

## Why I wrote this tutorial?

As a newcomer to programming and embedded systems, I was eager to gain practical experience. The idea of building a weather station caught my interest because it seemed like a feasible project with affordable components and beginner-friendly Python programming.

After successfully completing my weather station, I wanted to share my journey with others. Thus, this tutorial was created.

Motivation behind the tutorial:

  - Hands-on Learning: Constructing the weather station provided me with valuable experience in both Python programming and working with hardware.

  - Accessibility and Affordability: The project's low cost and simplicity in Python made it accessible to beginners like myself who are interested in exploring embedded systems.

  - Comprehensive Instructions: I wanted to create a tutorial that offers complete instructions, sparing others the need to search through several sources to build a simple weather station.

  - Improving Web Development Skills: Equally important was the opportunity to enhance my web development skills. By crafting this tutorial as a website using React Gatsby, I aimed to improve my abilities in web development while sharing my knowledge.

I hope this tutorial serves as a helpful resource for beginners looking to delve into the world of programming and embedded systems.
